# OCC Flowers rarity data

This repository contains tooling and data for [OCC Flowers](https://www.occ.xyz/flowers), and is free to use without credit or attribution, for any means.

> OCC#1 ðŸŒº Flowers is a collection 4096 programatically generated on-chain flowers, for you to own or to share. Each flower is 100% generated on-chain, including it's metadata. No ipfs/arweave, no external rendering script. Just SVGs created by the contract.

## Output

- `output/flowers.json` contains all tokenIds, their attributes, and base64 images.
- `output/occurrences.json` contains the number of occurrences by attribute.
- `output/rarity-occurrences.json` contains a mapping of `tokenId` to `score` (which is the sum of number of occcrences of each child attribute for a `tokenId`), sorted ascending by `score`. It also includes `rarest` which is how rare the flowers attributes are (`1` == `rarest`, `4096` == `least rare`), based on this specific ranking mechanism.
- `output/rarity-probability.json` contains a mapping of `tokenId` to `rank` by probabilistic occurence rather than rank.
- `output/rarity-rt-formula.json` contains a mapping of `tokenId` to `rank` using the [Rarity Tools](https://rarity.tools/) formula of `score = 1 / (sum of items with trait value / total items)`.
